Prior to the advent of blockchain technology in 2009 with the release of Bitcoin, such a revolutionary technology to drive evolution of the music industry remained out of the world's grasp.",

    "func-3-title": "Investment and rewards",
    "func-3-desc-1": "Users may invest in artists much like they might a stock in worldly capital markets, or rather lend to a musician to fund their project, much in the same way a loanholder might lend to a government or corporation.",
    "func-3-desc-2": "And just as with those more traditional modes of investment, investors in the Muzika ecosystem will collect dividends and/or interest according to their investment choices.",
    "func-4-title": "Community-wide Programs",
