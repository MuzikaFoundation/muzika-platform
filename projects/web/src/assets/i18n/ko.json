    "subtitle-1": "Muzika's core concept is that of an autonomous, self-sustaining ecosystem driven by content creators (music artists) and their fans in tandem. Prior to the advent of blockchain technology in 2009 with the release of Bitcoin, such a revolutionary technology to drive evolution of the music industry remained out of the world's grasp.",
    "subtitle-2": "With the creation of a new decentralized digital music ecosystem where anyone can participate in the production, investment, consumption, and distribution cycle of the music industry, Muzika will realize its goal of revolution."

    "subtitle-2": "MZK will serve as the sole medium of exchange for all economic activity within the ecosystem, facilitating investments, trades, and the allocation of investment returns, all while assisting growth via a few free services targeted at community novices."
